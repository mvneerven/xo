# PWA

When Building Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), you need a few things to be taken care of while you focus on building features.

The XO PWA class gives you:

- A hash based Router
- UI building features (areas, CSS3 grid helpers, dialogs, REST, notifications, etc)
- [The OmniBox](./omnibox.md)
- Utility methods (DOM parsing, etc)
