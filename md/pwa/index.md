# PWA

When Building Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), you need a few things to be taken care of while you focus on building features.

The XO PWA class gives you:

- A hash based [Router](./router.md)
- [UI](./ui.md) building features (areas, CSS3 grid helpers, dialogs, REST, notifications, etc)
- [The OmniBox](./omnibox.md)
- [Helper classes](./helpers.md) (DOM parsing, etc)

> # [This site](/) is entirely built with XO.
