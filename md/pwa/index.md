# PWA

When Building Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), you need a few things to be taken care of while you focus on building features.

The XO PWA class gives you:

- A PWA shell that gives you a lot of ready made functionality
  - A hash based [Router](./router.md)
  - A RouteModule base class you can inherit from
  - [UI](./ui.md) building features (areas, CSS3 grid helpers, dialogs, REST, notifications, etc)
  - [The OmniBox](./omnibox.md)
- A lot of extra utility methods

> ## [This site](/) is entirely built with XO.
