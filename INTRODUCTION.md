# XO-JS - Introduction

## The Problem

Large Enterprise, Multi-tenant SaaS apps are extremely configurable at all levels. Also, they need automated, self-service onboarding, in order to set the basics for a new tenant or user, manage user authorization, subscription management, and all data that the specific SaaS product needs to manage.

> Building complete front-ends in a bespoke way is a tedious, error-prone and costly undertaking.

Also, each of these developments adds overhead in terms of testing and deployment.

Lastly, maintaining consistence over all front-end facing application parts is not a small task.

## How does XO-JS solve this problem?

A way to solve all these issues at once, and speed up delivery of countless new front-end data-collecting requirements, is to have a highly flexible Forms Generator that can be fed declarative form schema data and automatically render forms.

Examples of this type of product are XForms generators, Wufoo, TypeForm, JotForms and others. 

Why develop a new one, then? 

> Well, because I've seen what developers need. They need to save as much time as needed, yet have all the power to themselves.

What does ExoForm bring?

* ExoForm gives developers complete freedom: simply include it in your development stack, and bypass, subclass, add anything you want. 
* No bulky dependencies. HTML5, CSS3, ECMAScript. That's it. They're powerful enough ;-) 
* Use it in any environment, Vue, React, Angular, or plain vanilla JavaScript.
